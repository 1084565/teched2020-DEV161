# Exercise 4 - Test the Application with Mock Server

In this exercise, we will test the application using mock data. This capability is very useful when decoupling frontend development from backend development. It's also useful for application debugging.

## Exercise 4.1 - Setup the Project to Auto-Refresh

    - [Exercise 4.3 - Load Data to Mock Server](exercises/ex2#exercise-22-sub-exercise-2-description)
    - [Exercise 4.4 - Run the app with User Provided Mock Data](exercises/ex2#exercise-22-sub-exercise-2-description)

After completing these steps you will have created...

1. Click here.

2.	Insert this line of code.
```abap
response->set_text( |Hello ABAP World! | ). 
```



## Exercise 4.2 - Run the Application with Auto-Generated Mock Data

After completing these steps you will have tested the app with mock data that was generated by the integrated mock server.

1.	Right-click any folder within the productsinventory folder, e.g. *webapp* folder, and select *Preview Application*.

2.	The *command palette* is opened with a list of npm scripts. Click *start-mock* to run this script.

    >A new browser tab is opened, where the app will be run.

    >A new tab is opened in SAP Business Application Studio, where the log of running the app is presented.

4. The app is run with mock data generated by the mock server.

## Exercise 4.3 - Run the Application with User-Provided Mock Data

After completing these steps you will have tested the app with mock data that you provide to the integrated mock server.

5.	Right-click the *localService* folder and select *New Folder*.

6. Name the folder *mockdata*, and click *OK*.

5. Click the following [link](data/Products.json?raw=true) to access the *Products* collection mock data.

6. Right-click the data area, and select *save as...*.

7. Choose the folder to where the file will be saved (*Downloads* is the default folder). Use *Products.json* as the *File name*, and click *Save*.

8. Open the folder to where you saved the file, and drag and drop it to the *mockdata* folder you created in SAP Business Application Studio.

    >You can follow the same steps for [Order_Details](data/Order_Details.json?raw=true), [Orders](data/Orders.json?raw=true), [Suppliers](data/Suppliers.json?raw=true), which will be used in a later stage of the workshop.

9. Go to the app's tab and refresh it (F5). The app presents the mock data you provided.

## Summary

You've now test run your app locally in the dev space using two mock data options: (1) mock data that is auto-generated by the mock server, and (2) mock data that you provided to the mock server.
