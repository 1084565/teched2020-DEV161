# Exercise 9 - Connect Your Project to SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery Service - Set Up the Service

In exercises 8 - 11, you will create a project in a public GitHub repository to which you'll store your source code, enable SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, and configure and run a predefined continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automatically tests, builds, and deploys your code changes.

In this exercise, you will enable the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service, and create and configure a predefined continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automatically tests, builds, and deploys your code changes.

## Summary

You've enabled the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service and created a predefined continuous integration and delivery pipeline. You've configured a GitHub webhook that links between the GitHub repository you created in a previous exercise and the pipeline. Now, whenever the GitHub repository updates, a build of the pipeline is triggered, which automatically builds, tests, and deploys your app to your space in SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime.
