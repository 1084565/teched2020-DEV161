# Exercise 9 - Connect Your Project to SAP Cloud Platform Continuous Integration and Delivery Service - Setup the Service

In this exercise, we will create a project in a public GitHub repository in which to store your source code, enable SAP Cloud Platform Continuous Integration and Delivery, and configure and run a predefined continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automatically tests, builds, and deploys your code changes.

## Exercise 9.4 Enable SAP Cloud Platform Continuous Integration and Delivery

After completing these steps, will have subscribed to SAP Cloud Platform Continuous Integration and Delivery and assigned the *Administrator* role to your user.

1. In your SAP Cloud Platform trial account, navigate to the **Subscriptions** tab.
Here, you can find the Continuous Integration & Delivery service:

If your user is new to your subaccount, choose **Add User** in the confirmation dialog.

7. Choose **Assign Role Collection**.

8. From the drop-down list, choose **CICD Service Administrator**.


## Exercise 9.5 Configure Credentials in SAP Cloud Platform Continuous Integration and Delivery

After completing these steps, you will have configured credentials for connecting SAP Cloud Platform Continuous Integration and Delivery to other services.

1. In your SAP Cloud Platform subaccount, choose **Subscriptions**.

2. In the **Extension Suite - Development Efficiency** category, choose **Continuous Integration & Delivery**.

3. Choose **Go to Application**.

4. Use your credentials to log in to the application.

5. If your GitHub repository is private, configure credentials for it, so that the Continuous Integration & Delivery service can connect to it. **Note:** If your GitHub repository isn't private, you can skip this step.

    - In the **Credentials** tab in SAP Cloud Platform Continuous Integration and Delivery, choose **+** *(Create Credentials)*.

    - For **Name**, enter a freely chosen name for your credential, which is unique in your SAP Cloud Platform subaccount. In this example, the name of the credential is *github*.
  
    - As **Type**, select **Basic Authentication**.

    - For **Username**, enter your Github username.
  
    - For **Password**, use the personal access token, which you've created in GitHub in exercise 8.2.

## Exercise 9.6 Configure a CI/CD Job

After completing these steps, you will have configured a job in SAP Cloud Platform Continuous Integration and Delivery.

1. In the **Jobs** tab in SAP Cloud Platform Continuous Integration and Delivery, choose **+** *(Create Job)*.
![Jobs](./images/CICD_jobs.png)

2. For **Job Name**, enter a freely chosen name for your job, which is unique in your SAP Cloud Platform subaccount. In this example, the name of the job is *Procurement*.

3. For **Repository URL**, enter the URL of your GitHub repository.

4. If your GitHub repository is private, for **Repository Credentials**, enter the name of the credentials to access your GitHub Repository, which you've created in exercise 8.5. If your GitHub repository isn't private, leave this field empty.

5. For **Branch**, enter the GitHub branch from which you want to receive push events.

6. As **Pipeline**, choose **sap-ui5-cf**.
