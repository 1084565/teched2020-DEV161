## Exercise 1.2 - Create Dev Space

SAP Business Application Studio provides turn-key solution based on what we call dev-spaces. Dev-Spaces are like isolated virtual machines in the cloud that can be instantly spinned up. 
Each Dev-Space type contains tailored tools and pre-installed runtimes for a target scenario such as SAP Fiori or mobile development. 
This simplifies and saves time in setting up the development environment as thereâ€™s no need to install anything or upgrade, letting developers to focus on their business domain, anytime, anywhere 

4. Now you can create your dev space! Click *Create Dev Space*.
